Python Discord raid tool project made by WHITEFACE
OPEN-SOURCE


# About

I am learning basic python so this is my first python project, so it is messy but I'll clean it.
This script was made in basic python 3, but discord raiding is definitely dead. 
Also for those skids, don't yoink my code and make utterly shitty software, you'll regret it.
